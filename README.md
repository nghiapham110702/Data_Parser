The objective of this project was to develop a data parsing tool that could efficiently extract information from both text and CSV files. The tool is designed to take input from a JSON file, which allows users to specify the type of data they wish to parse, as well as indicating which numeric data can be graphed.

This tool was created during my internship, where I worked on the development and implementation of the tool. Its purpose is to provide an efficient and easy-to-use solution for extracting and analyzing data from a variety of sources.

The tool uses a combination of parsing algorithms and data analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights from the input data. It is designed to be highly flexible, allowing users to customize their analysis and visualization options based on their specific needs.

Overall, this project represents a significant contribution to the field of data analysis and provides a valuable tool for businesses and individuals seeking to make sense of complex datasets.
